<p>As a result the last couple of eps haven’t been super exciting for me, because they’ve been more like settling into a familiar and comfortable routine.  We’re seeing character growth here but it’s subtle (apart from Shouyou, arguably).  I mean, Tobio being an asshole is nothing new – it’s kind of the foundation of his entire character arc.  Confronting whether his being an asshole is a problem for the Crows this directly is a bit of an evolution, and probably an overdue one at that, but the overall dynamic with Kageyama is basically unchanged.</p>
